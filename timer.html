<!-- So this is going to be simple, for now.
I am going to have a timer, default at 10 minutes.
Below it will be an input box, asking how long I want to work.
Below that will be an input box, asking how long I want a break for.
A "sound"? Y/N option would also be nice.
START
It will start, and then it will ring after the time is up, say, 10 minutes.
But unlike other timers, it will keep going, and it will record for how long I've been going.
Next time you start working, it will show you how long you worked last time, and you can choose to add more or less,
until you feel like actually working.
Maybe a table showing when I started working, stopped working, how long I worked etc. would also be nice.
I can maybe also let it add a description of what I was working on.
